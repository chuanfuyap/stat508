# [STAT 508](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat508/)
This github repository would host collection of example code/models within PennState STAT508 course, but it would be written in Python ([scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)) instead of the R code that is already available within the notes.

The code would be structured using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) for each lectures.
