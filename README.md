# [STAT 508](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat508/) Applied Data Mining and Statistical Learning
This github repository would host collection of example code/models found in PennState STAT508 Applied Data Mining and Statistical Learning course, but it would be written in Python ([scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)) instead of the R code that is already available within the notes.

The code would be written using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org), with one notebook for each lectures.
